# JourneyPal

## Description
**JourneyPal** is a travel-focused application designed to help users plan, track, and share their travel experiences. The app revolves around three core models:

1. **Cities**: Users can explore or add cities, learn about them, and add them to their list of potential destinations.
2. **Attractions**: Users can discover or add popular tourist spots and activities in the cities they are planning to visit.
3. **Bucket Lists**: Users can create personalised bucket lists of the attractions they want to visit, providing a great way to organise their travel plans.

The goal of **JourneyPal** is to make the travel experience more interactive and community-driven. Currently, users can create and manage their bucket lists, but future enhancements will allow users to add dates to their lists, creating an opportunity to connect with other travelers. If users have booked their trips, they will be able to share their travel dates with the community, allowing them to meet others who are visiting the same city at the same time.

This feature will build a sense of community and make the process of traveling even more social and engaging.

## Next Steps

### Planned Future Enhancements:

1. **Travel Dates & Community Features**: Users will be able to add specific dates to their bucket lists. If two or more users are visiting the same city at the same time, they will be notified and encouraged to connect with each other.
2. **User Profiles**: Personal profiles where users can share more about their travel experiences and bucket lists with other users, potentially including travel photos or itineraries.
3. **Messaging System**: A feature that enables users to message each other and arrange meetups if they are traveling to the same city at the same time.
4. **City Recommendations & Reviews**: Adding a review system where users can leave feedback on cities or attractions, helping future users make better travel decisions.
5. **Mobile App Development**: A mobile app version of JourneyPal to allow users to access their travel plans on the go.
